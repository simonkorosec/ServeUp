#### Setup Django environment in PyCharm

**Important:** Set up Virtualenv inside project, if Pycharm
doesn't do it by default.

1. Install virtualenv globally using: **pip install virutalenv**
2. https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/creating-virtual-environment.html
3. Activate venv with **source venv/bin/activate**

After a successful install, navigate into PyCharm terminal
and run command: **pip install -r requirements.txt**  
which will install all necessary dependencies for the project.

Verify by running the server **python manage.py**
